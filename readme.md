# README

## Dear Gerimedica developers

I wanted to give a quick update on what I've been working on. Here are some highlights:

## What I've Done

### General Experience

- **Overall Satisfaction**:
    - I'm happy with how things turned out! It's been a fun and productive time working on this project. I liked working
      more extensively with Java again.

- **Testing**:
    - While I’ve covered a lot of ground, there’s always room to add more detailed tests. It wouldn’t hurt to get a bit
      more thorough with unit and integration tests in the future.

### New Java Features

- **New Java Features**:
    - This was my first run at using some of the newer Java features, and I’ve gotta say, they’re pretty cool! They
      definitely helped make the code cleaner and more efficient.

### H2 Integration

- **H2 Rocks**:
    - Integrating with the H2 in-memory database has been super convenient. It really streamlined testing and
      development. Thumbs up for H2!

### Personal Note

- **Thank you**:
    - I really appreciate having the chance to show what I can do. It’s been a great experience, and I've enjoyed
      working on this project.

- **Stay Tuned**:
    - Looking forward to your feedback and hopefully more opportunities to work together. Can't wait to hear back from
      you!

Thanks again for the opportunity!

Cheers,
Lukas
